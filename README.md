## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Click the "Use this template" button or create a new repository from this template in GitHub.

2. Clone the repository using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
```

3. Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
# or
yarn
```

4. Start the development server:

## ðŸ”§ Customization
Now that your project is up and running, you can start customizing it. Add components inside the component Folder, pages, and styles as needed. You can also configure ESLint and TailwindCSS to better suit your development workflow.

- Remember to update this README file to reflect your project's unique features, requirements, and instructions for other developers.
<br>
<br>

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
